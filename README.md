Assignment 1 -Plots

For this assignment 2 datasets are downloaded from the website https://data.gov.in/ 
One is used for Scatter Plot and Bar Plot and the other one for Box Plot and Line Plot.

## Scatter Plot
Data for Scatter plot is downloaded from https://data.gov.in/resources/stateut-wise-forest-cover-india-state-forest-report-isfr-during-2015from-ministry

The data gives the State/UT-wise Forest cover as per India State of Forest Report (ISFR) during 2015(From : Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change)

Here the independent variables are the states and the dependent variables are the Geographical area, Total forest cover and percentage of area under forest cover.
Since the independent variables or the states are not related to each other, to analyse this type of data Scatter plot can be used with X axis as the states and Y axis as the dependent variables.
To do an analysis, we plot both the Total geographical area as well as the Forest cover in each state using Blue and Red color as shown in below plot.
